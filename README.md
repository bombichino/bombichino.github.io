# Boostrap Portfolio Redesign 

The goal of this project is to use our newfound Boostrap skills to begin a redesign of our portfolio page.

## Chief Execution

Wherein we must include index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html pages as well as navbar elements and responsive layout/pictures.

- I took the barebones skeleton of a portfolio page from earlier activities to draw from.
- Using Boostrap documentation, chose a navbar element.
- Using Boostrap's grid layout, designed the basics of content, images, bio information, all to be filled in over time.
- Left room for further design elements as time goes on.
- Began incorporating contact form, not currently happy with host of choice. Will find an alternative for future functionality. Current form included as a placeholder; see pseudocode on contact.html
- As the class progressed, added responsive elements and projects amassed through the semester.

## Future improvements

- Polish design further, search for more dynamic backgrounds and refine color scheme.
